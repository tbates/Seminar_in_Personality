### Week One

Overview of the next 5 weeks of [MV stats](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/current/dpt/cxpsyl11054.htm)

1. **Factor analysis**
2. Structural Equation Modelling
3. CFA
4. Path Analysis
5. Latent variable modeling

Introduces you to the idea of latent variables, the concept of a path diagram, and also how to do a factor analysis in R.

Show how the EFA needs to fix latent variances at 1 and covariances at 0, and fix the upper right triangle of whatever matrix contains the latent loadings.

Show what rotation does (R is great for that - just pull the loadings matrix and throw in at promax() or varimax().

Introduce indeterminacy by talking about how the rotations do not differ in fit.

### How many factors?
#### Horn's Parallel analysis

### Rotation

We now now about loadings

### Scores: Why scores are not just data %*% loadings

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4145400/how-to-create-factors-from-factanal

Can we construct scores on our factors?

An intuition might be: Factors = data matrix * Loadings matrix.

1. Thomson Regression method restriction that the scores are uncorrelated, centered around 0 and with variance = 1.
 * 'scale(m1) %*% solve(cor(m1)) %*% loadings(fa)'
2. Bartlett's method
3. ML


```splus
v1 <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,4,5,6)
v2 <- c(1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,3,4,3,3,3,4,6,5)
v3 <- c(3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,4,6)
v4 <- c(3,3,4,3,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,5,6,4)
v5 <- c(1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,6,4,5)
v6 <- c(1,1,1,2,1,3,3,3,4,3,1,1,1,2,1,6,5,4)
m1 <- cbind(v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6)

fa <- factanal(m1, factors=3,scores="regression")

fa$scores # the correct solution

fac <- m1 %*% loadings(fa) # the answer on your question
```

```splus
> round(cor(fac),2)
        Factor1 Factor2 Factor3
Factor1    1.00    0.79    0.81
Factor2    0.79    1.00    0.82
Factor3    0.81    0.82    1.00

> round(cor(fac2),2)
        Factor1 Factor2 Factor3
Factor1       1       0       0
Factor2       0       1       0
Factor3       0       0       1
```

#### What happens with missing data

**Next week**: We will convert this model to CFA. Use a real data set so it has a purpose.

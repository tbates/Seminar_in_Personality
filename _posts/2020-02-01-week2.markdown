### Week 2

1. Factor analysis
2. **Structural Equation Modelling**
3. CFA
4. Path Analysis
5. Latent variable modeling

In week two we will leverage the modelling you already know by building the equivalent of `lm(y ~ x + z)` in `umx` package.

This leverages two ideas you already understand: Factor analysis and linear models/ANOVA.</li>

*Curb your enthusiasm*: By week 2 you should understand what boxes, circles, triangles, diamonds, and straight and curved arrows are.

### Assessment

Three elements contribute to your mark: Your presentation (10% for the summary and 10% for your talk), your general participation (10%), and the final paper (a grant proposal) (70%).

**Who's assigned to what**
When you choose a topic, please [edit this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-fig7hfRKLebcHXXgjzmayVlHjdZ4h5P-S5x-jXVTeI/edit#). If you can't, ask tim.bates@ed.ac.uk for help.


### Weekly discussion
Each week one of you will lead a discussion. You will need to choose one or more papers to discuss. You should then communicate these to the course organizers who will determine whether they are suitable. You will then write a 1-2 page summary using the “In Course Presentation” guide. Finally, the week before your presentation you will email the pdfs to us. On the week of your presentation you will hand out your summary, walk people through the summaries, and lead the discussion that follows. 
We will aim to have two presentations each week. The discussion of the paper or papers you choose will therefore take approximately one hour. 
Below we list several “big topics” and the major papers that have contributed to the scientific debate on these topics. You might well pick one of these papers for your topic. Alternatively, you can use these as a guide to find recent papers that address the topic.
 
* [The trait-situation debate]()
* [Personality structure]()
* [Genetic and familial influences on personality]()
* [Evolutionary psychology of personality]()

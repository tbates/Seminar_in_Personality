### Assessment

Three elements contribute to your mark:

1. 30% class
	* 10% for summary.
	* 10% for your presentation.
	* 10 % for participation.
2. 70% final paper (Aims and background section of a grant proposal).

### Weekly discussion
Each week one of you will lead a discussion. You will need to choose one or more papers to discuss. You should then communicate these to the course organizers who will determine whether they are suitable. You will then write a 1-2 page summary using the “In Course Presentation” guide. Finally, the week before your presentation you will email the pdfs to us. On the week of your presentation you will hand out your summary, walk people through the summaries, and lead the discussion that follows. 
We will have one to two presentations each week. The discussion of the paper or papers you choose will take approximately one hour. 

Below we list several “big topics” and the major papers that have contributed to the scientific debate on these topics. You might well pick one of these papers for your topic. Alternatively, you can use these as a guide to find recent papers that address the topic.
 
* [Personality structure]()
* [Measurement of personality]()
* [Psychopathology]()
* [Effortful control]()
* [Personality influences on health & well-being]()
* [Business|Business(e.g Leadership, Entrepreneurship etc) and Personality]()
* [Genetic and familial influences on personality]()
* [Personality change and development]()
* [Personality in non-human animals]()
* [Evolutionary psychology of personality]()
* [Personality and culture]()
* [The trait-situation debate]()
* [Alternatives to traits]()
* [Philosophical ideas about identity]()

**Who's assigned to what**

When you choose a topic, please edit this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-fig7hfRKLebcHXXgjzmayVlHjdZ4h5P-S5x-jXVTeI/edit#).

### Understanding personality
#### A good check of whether we understand personality, is the ability to predict the behaviors it causes.

 * Try your hand at [writing behavior items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_IFq-FSlid059wMpi-tlhANdh7qexXpqRt0U7lQ3vKg/edit) in this google doc.
 * What behaviours differentiate hi/lo people on N,E,O,A,C? e.g. do hi-C people fold their underwear (and low C not, and other dimensions don't affect this?
 * What would an extrovert/introvert or stable vs unstable or conscientious vs unconscientious person find hard to do/not do?

### How is personality measured?

Here are some of the measures we will use in the course. You should log in (use your matriculation ID) and take them. Again: Seeing exactly what is in a questionnaire avoids the [jingle-jangle fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle-jangle_fallacies) and promotes insight.
